# AlgoTrading

This is a GIT repo to store my assignment work in the subject Algorithmic Trading (FNCE30010) , at the University of Melbourne (Semester 2, 2020) This subject is a quota'd subject at ~30 students a semester.

Assignment 1:

Build a bot to trade on a simulated market, consisting of one product. Simulated market consists of a public and private market, selling "widgets" with prices between 0-1000. Performance is evaluated on profit made, as well as adherence of liquidity constraints.

Assignment 2:

Build a bot to trade on a multi-asset market, consisting of 3 "stocks" as well as a note guaranteeing payment of $5.00 upon expiry of the trading session. Stocks are traded between prices 0.00 - 10.00. At the end of the market session, a market "state" is drawn reflecting bull/bear/neutral scenarios in which each stock has a unique payout profile. Performance is evaluated on risk-adjusted performance, based on expected payout minus a penalty for variance.
